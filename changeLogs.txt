Version 3.01.01

# **English**
With a new main version comes a lot of changes.

## New Features
* Three new for-aesthetic params: CascadingUnderflow, CULenience ("CU" here being short for "CascadingUnderflow"), and RememberResults
  * The first decides whether the second or later lines of any given wrapped text can be wider than the first
  * The second decides how much wider than the first that later lines can be
  * The third decides whether the wrapper will keep track of its output so that when wrapping the same thing more than once, it returns said output instead of going through the usual process
    * If your game uses more than one font, you might want to set this to false
* The NametagFormats param has been overhauled; it is no longer an array of strings, but one of a new struct with these fields:
  * Name: just what it sounds like 
  * RegexAsString: where you type in the regex like you did in version 2.01.03
  * Enabled: whether or not the algorithm will consider the format when looking for nametags. You can set it to false instead of deleting the format entirely from the array.
  * Notes: so you can add more info about the entry.
* The default formats have been changed to accomodate the new structure. Said formats cover these (colored or otherwise):
  * Those that end with colons
  * Those enclosed in square brackets
* A new algorithm-informing tag: <noNametagDetection>
  * You use this when you want the algorithm to treat a textbox as not having a nametag. This is good for games using the normal, ends-in-a-colon format; 
  they can now use that mark in non-nametag-having boxes without the algorithm seeing one where there isn't any

## Bugfixes
* Line-break tags no longer have to be separated from other words by spaces
  * This means that text like "What up?<br2>How's it goin'?<br2>" works just as well as "What up? <br2> How's it goin'? <br2>"
  * Now, languages (such as Japanese and Chinese) that don't separate words with any specific character can actually make use of these tags!
* Yanfly MessageCore nametags are now properly detected
  * The algorithm always watches out for when a Yanfly nametag is shown on screen, so no need to add a format for it there

## compatibility
* There may be compatibility issues with the 2.x.x versions of the Precision and Letter-Based Word Wrap plugins
  * Best get the 3.x.x versions

Included a new User Guide to help you better understand the new features. Please check it out. Also, if you're upgrading from an earlier version of this plugin, please make sure
to (after having this overwrite the old version) remove and readd it to the PluginManager, reconfiguring things as you like. This update adds new params and changes an old one, 
so you need to do this to make sure all the params will work right.
